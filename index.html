     <h2> <b>What I love</b> </h2>
     <div class="block">
            <li><h3>Books</h3></li> 
            <p>Reading feels to me is like soothing process which is slowly making the bond between my Mind and Heart stronger.
             There are a lot more emotions and actions that take place inside of us which I cannot put in words.
             We just let them be the way they want to, Natural and Loving throughout this lives. Never stop reading</p>

     <div class="block">
            <li><h3>Traveling</h3></li>
            <p>Traveling brings Joy to your life, It makes you a better person,
             it makes you more helpful towards people,
              it brings you out of your comfortzone, 
              it makes you feel alive & happy & 
              most importantly it opens up new horizons of your mind 
              to think in different ways with different prospectives.</p>

      <div class="block">             
            <li><h3>Learnin new languages</h3></li>
            <p>You feel a growing pleasure, 
             and you feel more in control because you can use a language – a string ofwords 
             and sounds that was previously completely unknown –
              to communicate.
               Even something as simple as learning how to express a 
               feeling or statement in another language makes you feel
               powerful</p>
